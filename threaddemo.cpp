 * - Use operator() to add a new task to the pool.
 * - A thread pool has a certain number of threads. Tasks can
 *   be added to the pool any time, even when all threads are
 *   busy (the thread pool will never refuse new tasks because
 *   it is "full"). When all threads are busy, new tasks wait
 *   until a thread becomes available.

 * - wait() on a condition variable may return without reason

 *   waiting for has actually occured
